## Welcome
My name is Ethan Slattery and I am currently an undergraduate student at Saddleback College studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in using engineering skills to work on conservation and the exploration of the natural world.

When I am not programming, doing CAD, or soldering I like to spend my time outdoors SCUBA diving, rock climbing, hiking, or trying to find elusive animals.
